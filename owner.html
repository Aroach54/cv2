    <h3>Lloyd Christmas</h3>
    <p>
      Lloyd Virgil Christmas is a well-meaning, determined, but a terribly immature,
      dense, loud, abrasive, vituperative, contumelious, and obnoxious man with an
      extremely low intelligence. This handsome brunette gentleman sometimes shows quite
      a cruel, snakey, sleazy, and vengeful streak, like when he sold a dead
      parakeet to Billy and when he spiked Harry's drink with laxative.
      There were also times when he showed some intelligence, for instance when
      he tricked Sea Bass using a technique he saw in a movie, albeit not
      remembering that the characters in that film got their throats slit.
      Lloyd, though not exactly intentional given his stupidity and ignorance
      of social norms, can be reprehensibly rude and insensitive at times
      hit or miss.Lloyd overestimates himself immensely. In his dream
      sequences, he believes himself extremely charming and romantic.
      He also believed himself greatly skilled in martial arts.
      His stupidity and lack of common sense can sometimes lead to
      horrific accidents, most notably the death
      of his friend Peter Stainer. Lloyd also happens to have a
      pretty illogical and shallow idea of women. As when Harry
      said he was going to set him up with a woman his own age,
      Lloyd said "My Age? Gross!"
    </p>
    <p>However, for all his bluster, Lloyd is a deeply caring, happy, and loving man who is extremely loyal to his friends, especially his best one, Harold "Harry" Dunne. He refuses to give up even when all seems lost.....that is, if a pretty woman
      (or
      a picture of one) happens to be an incentive.

      Like his best friend, Harry, Lloyd is also pathetically ignorant of most facts of life as he believed simply man handling a woman would get her pregnant with no clue how babies are made until his mid 40s. He is completely incapable of making
      smart decisions since he traded the van for a mini bike. He is also unable to read. For example, after finding Mary Swanson in the newspaper, he could not even read out the simplest words.</p>

    <h1>Harry Dunne</h1>
    <p>Harold Avery "Harry" Dunne is an incredibly nebbishy, oafish, giggly, cute, danger-prone, ignorant, infantile, bubbly, ditsy, and naive gentleman. He is a best friend to the doubly immature Lloyd Christmas. However, at his core, he is sweet
      towards others, and has a loving, sweet, kind, gracious, free, and gentle spirit. In the second film, his skinnier frame transforms into a rather pudgier one. However, the change of his appearance does not hide his charisma and beauty.

      On some things, he is a tad smarter and more logically minded than Lloyd. Not only is he more literate, (as shown in the first film), he is quite aware that it would be inappropriate (maybe even illegal) for Lloyd to date, never mind to marry,
      a
      woman 20 years his junior (as shown in the second.)

      Harry is also a breathtakingly handsome man, and it shows, as he charms Beth Jordan, (a woman who worked with the FBI, posing as a desperate lady running from her boyfriend), and even Mary Swanson, (much to Lloyd's chagrin, of course!) He and
      his
      friend also allure several swimsuit models on the Hawaiian Tropics Bus (as demonstrated at the end of the first film.)

      It has been revealed that Harry had not intended for himself and Mary to get together, but later, as he, Mary, and Lloyd were held hostage by Andre, Harry considered that moment as revenge, as his then-main squeeze, Fraida Felcher, told him
      that
      Lloyd was the one she had been seeing all along.</p>
    <p>Brave even, Harry will sacrifice his own life to save those of his friends! (Shows you how much more guts Harry has got than his best friend does!) To illustrate this, after Harry had come to (after being shot by the sinister Andre), he saves
      (or tries to save, anyway) Lloyd and Mary by shooting back at him. Unfortunately, he misses! (But no worries; Beth Jordan saves the two men, the woman, and the day!) Also, when poor little Penny was about to be shot by the vicious Adele, sweet
      Harry had sacrificed his life to save Penny's, much to hers and Lloyd's horror.

      Furthermore, the vacuous and airheaded Harry (in his own way) can be as terribly guileful as Lloyd. For example, as Harry had taken Lloyd from the mental institute, he said he needed a new kidney from his closest relative. Since his adoptive
      parents (rationally) couldn't give him one, his real parents were dead, and he couldn't get one from Penny, as the heartbroken Harry had found out that he wasn't Penny's father, Lloyd had taken one from his own body and gave it to Harry. This
      practical joke had served the immature Lloyd right after having wasted Harry's life (as well as his own!) After being shot by Adele, Harry was rushed to the hospital with Lloyd, Penny, and Fraida in tow.</p>
